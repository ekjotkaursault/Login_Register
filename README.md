### Reflections
I encountered difficulties while working on this project, particularly with the login section.  The registration page was functioning OK, however it kept failing when I attempted to log in using the same credentials.  I was unsure about how to correctly connect the backend, frontend, and MongoDB because I don't have much experience with the entire MERN authentication process.  I looked through a number of internet guides and documents to resolve this.  I examined the typical login and authentication setups for MERN apps, with a focus on Express routes, bcrypt, and MongoDB.  I then revised and modified the code to fit the configuration of my own project.  Before the login eventually functioned, the majority of the time was spent testing and resolving issues.

### Notes on Styling
I utilized simple Unicode symbols and emojis, such ‚úÖ (success), ‚ùå (error), üö´ (not allowed), etc., to display status signals, such as success or error.
These are simply standard text characters that function on the majority of computers; they are not borrowed from any other library.
I simply used them to improve the clarity and usability of messages for debugging.

In order to make the webpage appear cleaner and more contemporary, I also employed a few fonts.  
This was primarily done for presentational reasons, making sure that the register and login pages not only functioned but also looked good.  
I imported React icons and framer motion for this purpose.
