### Features

- MongoDB + Express backend integration


I encountered issues with the login portion while creating this. Even with the correct login information, the registration process was successful. Due to my lack of experience with complete MERN auth, I was unsure of how to correctly connect the frontend, backend, and MongoDB.  


I looked through a ton of web guides, documents, Youtube tutorials  to figure things out. I saw how Express routes, bcrypt, and MongoDB are typically used for login and authentication. I then followed those instructions and continued to test until my setup was successful. I spent much of my time troubleshooting minor issues, but eventually I was able to get it to function.
